    Covering the news involves a wide range of tasks, from shaping a story idea to polishing copy for publication. We offer tools to help you learn those skills by working with AI models that will coach you rather than just doing the work for you.  

    **Journalist's Toolkit works like this:**
    * pick a task and think it through by answering the kinds of questions an editor would ask
    * that info is combined with a "prompt" engineered to get the best out of an AI bot
    * you take that prompt to a bot, which will guide you through a constructive discussion leading to a "next steps" plan 

    Along the way, you'll gain insight into what AI bots do and don't do well, and how to get the most out of an AI collaboration.
